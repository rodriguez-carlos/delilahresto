# Delila Rest√≥ API
### Getting started

1. From the project root, if mysql environment is up and running and you have mysql client installed, run  `mysql --user="yourusername" --database="delilah_db_carlosDWFS" --password="yourpassword" < "/delilah_db.sql"` on a command line. Otherwise, user may download file "delilah_db.sql" from the project root and import it directly into phpmyadmin or other mysql GUI. Connection parameters are configured in file "db-config.js", where user may adjust the values to connect to their own mysql server. This step will have set up a database called `delilah_db_carlosDWFS`.
2. From the project root, run `npm install`. After installing dependencies, run `npm run devStart`. Database tables are created after running `npm run devStart`. DB will be functional at this point as the server is running.
